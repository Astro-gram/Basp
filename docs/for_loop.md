# For Loop

For loop allows for ```break``` and ```continue``` keywords

```c
for (value in ["string", "string2"]) {
    //loop through each element in array
}
```

```c
for (index in (0, 2, 1)) {
    //index starts at 0, goes through 2 loops, and steps by 1
}
```

```c
for (index in 5) {
    //Loop 5 times
}
```
